            <p id="introtext">Arsenic is one of the most interesting and enigmatic elements of the periodic table. 
               Its use as an intentional poison has been known for centuries and occasionally occurs today. 
               Arsenic has been called the <button class="pop-up" data-text="For centuries, arsenics image as a poison has been 
               inextricably tied to images of foul play.">King of Poisons,</button> John Parascandola examines the surprising history of this deadly, 
               because it had been used to poison royalty 
               and thus alter who would ascend to the throne. 
               
               The development of the Marsh test, by James Marsh in 1830s, a simple analytical 
               method to detect arsenic, may be a reason why intentional arsenic poisonings decreased.

            seemingly perfected it by using arsenic and verdigris for a more steadfast green. The pigment could also be mixed to create bright yellows and rich blues, perfect for

            That arsenic was poisonous was certainly not a secret; every Victorian home had a bit of the powder lying around for rats and mice, and people likely knew tales of the 
            “inheritance powder” being used for murder. Yet they also applied arsenic cosmetics, gave their children toys painted with arsenic, wore dresses and hats dyed with arsenic, 
            and ate meat dipped into it to keep away flies.
